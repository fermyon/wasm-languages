# Motoko in WebAssembly

Motoko is a high-level programming language that is designed for writing Internet Computer canisters. It leverages a simple design for everyday programmers and supports an underlying Wasm and IC execution model. 

## Uses

Motoko can be used to develop Internet Computer canisters. The Internet Computer is the worldâ€™s first blockchain that runs at web speed and can increase its capacity without bound. 

## Available Implementations

Motoko has an [official implementation](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko) that supports Wasm and WASI out of the box.
