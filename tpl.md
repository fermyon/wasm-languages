# X in WebAssembly

<!--
A sentence or two about the language. Make sure to say whether it is scripting, compiled, etc.

The idea here should be to help a newcomer understand that, for example, Rust is a compiled systems language
while Python is a general purpose scripting language.
-->

## Available Implementations

<!--
List official implementations first, and other implementations as well.

Make sure to link to the website or repository
-->

## Usage

<!--
This section should just talk about how this project is to be used.

For example, TinyGo might show how to compile to WASI
-->

## Pros and Cons

<!-- List out some pros and cons of this language vs others WHEN IT COMES TO WASM 

For example, might point out that the Swift runtime requires large binaries or that
an unofficial implementation lags behind the core language's feature set. Or might
point out really good tooling or performance.

## Example

>> All of our examples follow [a documented pattern using common tools](/wasm-languages/about-examples).

<!-- If possible, show a code example and instructions for compiling.

When possible, show (by priority)

- Spin
- Wagi
- Wasmtime
