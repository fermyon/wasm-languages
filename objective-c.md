# Objective-C in WebAssembly

It seems like Objective-C to WebAssembly should be possible in no small part because of LLVM.
However, we haven't tracked down any examples or implementations.

Apple is hinting that not only do they have such a tool, but they use it in their apps.

According to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/lrz/status/1250453967957561344?s=20):

> What have I been working on lately? Just a few days ago, iWork 10.0 shipped with iCloud apps that now include features extracted from the native codebase (C++/ObjC), using WebAssembly!

(See the rest of the thread for more info.)
