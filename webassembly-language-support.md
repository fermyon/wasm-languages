This guide tracks support for compiling a language to WebAssembly. It is organized into three sections: Support for the top 20 languages, WebAssembly-specific languages, and other notable languages. We track whether the language can be compiled to run in the browser, in other non-browser environments, and in a [WASI](https://wasi.dev) environment. In the detail page for each language, we do our best to not only state the current level of support, but also point to an array of useful resources.

## WebAssembly Support in Top 20 Languages

This reports on the top 20 languages from [RedMonk's ranking](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/03/28/language-rankings-1-22/).
Some languages, like CSS, PowerShell, and "Shell", don't really have a meaningful expression in Wasm. However, we have left them here for completeness.

* _Core_ means there is an implementation of WebAssembly 1.0
* _Browser_ means there is at least one browser implementation
* _WASI_ means the language supports at least Preview 1 of the WASI proposal
* _Spin SDK_ indicates there is a Spin SDK for the language

Anything with WASI or Spin SDK support runs on Fermyon Cloud, Spin, and Fermyon Platform.

## WebAssembly Specific Languages

| Language                         | Browser | CLI | WASI | Spin SDK |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --- | ---- | -------- |
| [AssemblyScript][AssemblyScript] | ✅      | ✅  | ✅   | ❌       |
| [Grain][Grain]                   | ✅      | ✅  | ✅   | ❌       |
| [Motoko][Motoko]                 | ✅      | ✅  | ✅   | ❌       |

* _Browser_ means there is at least one browser implementation
* _CLI_ means the language has a CLI runtime mode
* _WASI_ means the language supports at least Preview 1 of the WASI proposal
* _Spin SDK_ indicates there is a Spin SDK for the language

## Other Notable Languages

These languages enjoy broad use (though perhaps not in the top 20) and have at least some degree of WebAssembly Support

| Language                  | Browser | CLI | WASI | Spin SDK |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --- | ---- | -------- |
| [COBOL][Cobol]            | ⏳      | ✅  | ⏳   | ❌       |

* _Browser_ means there is at least one browser implementation
* _CLI_ means the language has a CLI runtime mode
* _WASI_ means the language supports at least Preview 1 of the WASI proposal
* _Spin SDK_ indicates there is a Spin SDK for the language

## How To Read These Charts

For each environment, we use the following icons to indicate a level of support:

- ✅  Usable
- ⏳ In progress
- ❌ Not implemented
- `N/A` Not applicable

Spin, Fermyon Platform and Fermyon Cloud require [WASI](https://wasi.dev) support. Any language that has a ✅ for WASI should be supported on the Fermyon Platform. The *Spin SDK* indicates that there is additional libraries available for Spin.

We are often asked which languages are best supported for production-grade WebAssembly. We suggest [C][C]/[C++][CPLUSPLUS], [Rust][Rust], and [AssemblyScript][AssemblyScript].
