# PowerShell and WebAssembly

PowerShell is consistently ranked among the top programming languages.
However, it is not generally considered to be a general purpose language like [C](/wasm-languages/c-lang) or [Python](/wasm-languges/python).
So we were a little surprised to find at least some information about PowerShell and WebAssembly.

Most of it stems from the fact that the Blazor WebAssembly framework frequently uses PowerShell [in the examples](https://stackshare.io/stackups/powershell-vs-webassembly).

We think it is unlikely that PowerShell will ever be compiled to WebAssembly.
