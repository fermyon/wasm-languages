# Dart in WebAssembly

Dart is a programming language designed for client development. The Dart team is
actively developing support for Wasm along with the Chrome team's work on
[Wasm-GC](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6062715726462976). The source code
for this work-in-process can be found
[in the Dart SDK repository](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/main/pkg/dart2wasm).

Dart also supports loading and running Wasm modules via
[package:wasm](https://github.com/dart-lang/wasm).

## Pros and Cons

We will update this once `dart2wasm` has been released.

## Examples

We will update this once `dart2wasm` has been released.

Here are some great resources:

- The [Dart2Wasm](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/main/pkg/dart2wasm) tool
  is in the official SDK
- This
  [blog post](https://medium.com/dartlang/experimenting-with-dart-and-wasm-ef7f1c065577)
  outlines the efforts to explore Dart and Wasm.
- There is a [tracking issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/32894) for
  Dart-to-Wasm work.
- [Source code](https://github.com/dart-lang/wasm) for `package:wasm`.
- Flutter now has [WebAssembly support for the browser](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/wasm)
