# Haskell in WebAssembly

[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is a purely functional programming language.

## Available Implementations

The Asterius project compiles Haskell to WebAssembly.

## Usage

Asterius targets Node.js and the browser.
It also appears to support `wasm32-wasi`, though we have not tested it.

## Pros and Cons

<!-- List out some pros and cons of this language vs others WHEN IT COMES TO WASM 

For example, might point out that the Swift runtime requires large binaries or that
an unofficial implementation lags behind the core language's feature set. Or might
point out really good tooling or performance.
